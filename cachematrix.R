## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## It creates a list with these functions:
##        -set: set the value of the matrix
##        -get: get the value of the matrix
##        -setsolve: set the value of the inverse
##        -getsolve: get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
